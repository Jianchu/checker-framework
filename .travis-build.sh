## Documentation
ant javadoc-private
# Skip the manual because it cannot be compiled on Ubuntu 12.04.
# make -C checker/manual all

## Temporary, for testing
# This succeeds and does not reproduce the problem: (cd checker && ant -d interning-tests)
(cd checker && ant -Demit.test.debug=true all-tests-nojtreg-nobuild-only-interning)

# ## Tests
# # The JDK was built above; there is no need to rebuild it again.
# # Don't use "-d" to debug ant, because that results in a log so long
# # that Travis truncates the log and terminates the job.
# ant tests-nobuildjdk
# 
# (cd checker && ant check-compilermsgs check-purity)
# (cd checker && ant check-tutorial)
# 
# # It's cheaper to run the demos test here than to trigger the
# # checker-framework-demos job, which has to build the whole Checker Framework.
# (cd checker && ant check-demos)
